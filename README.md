## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am @caz002, a software engineer based with experience coding applications for broadcast media and medical research. I love designing and building innovative user experiences, and am looking for more opportunities to develop my skills. Feel free to reach out on here or by email!

Outside of coding, I also enjoy arts, crafts, and reading new books.
